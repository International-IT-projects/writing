# excel task system

An excel web user interface where you can define state machines to power websites and systems.

I want a distributed computing pseudo content addressed speadsheet where each cell is a process, thread, function, server, program, user, avatar or API.
I can type "=" for inserting a formula into a cell like Excel then type a repl.it template and bring up a server, or a template environment with everything preconfigured.

I want to depend on other people's solutions to problems. We are all independently running agents.

Perhaps it could be a chat room similar to a MUD where each person runs servers and runs programs that depend on eachother. A mesh of computation and storage.

Perhaps there should be some central hub which tracks the state of different services and workflows, similar to Temporal.io.
